DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 AND HTTP 2
HTTP 1.1
   1. HTTP 1.1 keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.
   2. HTTP 1.1 which must make use of multiple TCP connection.
   3. programs like gzip have long been used to compress the data sent in HTTP message.
   4. HTTP relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow.
   5. Each new TCP connection requires a seperate flow control connection.
   6.It user requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.
   7.There is head of line blocking that blocks all requests behind it until it does't get its all resources.
   8.Process requests and responses sequentially'

 HTTP 2
    1.HTTP uses the binary farming layer to encapsulated all messages in binary format.
    2.HTTP 2 establishes a single connection object between the two machine.
    3.The HTTP 2 specific compression program HPACK can then compress the header frame.
    4.Multiplexes streams with in a single TCP connection.
    5.We will have to implement flow control in different manner.
    6.It uses push frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
    7.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
    8.IT allows for multiplexing enabling multiple streams of a data be exchanged simultaneously over a single connection.

    That is a major difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2.I am awaiting  your valuable feedback.once again thank you,sir.
