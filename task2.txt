OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT
OBJECTS:
  1.Objects are important data types in javascript.
  2.Objects are different than primitive datatypes.
  3.Primitive data types contain one value but objects can hold many values in the form of key:value pair.
  4.These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.
   eg:
      var mycar =new object();

   Creating Objects in Javascript  
    1. By Object literal
    2. By creating instance of object directly.

     The syntax of creating object 
      var objectname=new object();
       
       eg: 
            var emp=new object();
            emp.id-101;
            emp.name="xxx";
            emp.salary=50000

     Accessing javascript objects:
          objectName.property      
       eg:
          accessing 'fname' from exampleb1 using dot operator,
            person.fname

          accessing 'name'from example 2 using [],
            eg: emp["name"] 

    That is a object and it is a internal representaion of javascript.i am awaiting your valuable feedback.once again thank you, sir
